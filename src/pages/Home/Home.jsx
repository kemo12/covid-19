            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
            moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
            treatment.
          </Typography>

            Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
            cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
            cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

          <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom align="left">
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
            informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it
            spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your
            hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your
            face.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" gutterBottom align="left">
            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
            discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,
            so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette .

            To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the

            </li>
            <li>
              Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing
